getquote

This program gets prices for any stock quote that is entered in on the command
line, and then calculates various percentages based on the high close and the
high high. Right now, it calculates 1%, 2%, 4% and 10%. This will be a 
configurable option later on.

It does this by going to Yahoo, downloading a csv file and then parsing the
file for the necessary data. Right now, it takes this information and creates
an HTML page. This will be refined later on to be able to define where to put
it. Right now the path is /var/www, which assumes a Linux OS.

I will be updating this program periodically and things might change with
outputs and percentages. Stay tuned.
